This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Project Name 
Jammusik

## Description

We are a useful and well thought out tool for musicians. Offering a number of features focused on the organization and management of playlists and songs, both for rehearsals and live performances.
1. Playlist Creation and Management:
Allows users to create custom playlists and add songs to them. These songs are displayed on cards that facilitate the visualization and tracking of played and pending songs.
2. Marking Songs:
Song cards can be marked as they are played, which helps musicians keep clear track of their setlist during a performance or rehearsal.
3. Detailed Information by Song:
For each selected song, users can add useful information such as chords, key, notes, tablature links and lyrics. This is particularly useful during rehearsals.
4. Categorization by Music Genre:
The application includes a categories section that allows users to filter songs by musical genre, making it easy to search for songs by musical category or genre.
It is important to note that, in this version, the app does not play music; its main focus is the management and organization of playlists for musicians.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
